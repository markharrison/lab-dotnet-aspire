## Introduction

.NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications.

This hands on lab starts with a Web App / API App and converts it to use the .NET Aspire tooling, components, patterns and practices.

Note the term 'components' used in .NET Aspire 8.0 was renamed 'integrations' for .NET Aspire 9.0.
